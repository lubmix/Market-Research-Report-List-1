<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Resin Modifier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monofunctional Modifier</li><li>Multifunctional Modifier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane resin modifiers come in two main types: monofunctional and multifunctional. Monofunctional modifiers are compounds that have one reactive functional group, which can crosslink with the polyurethane resin to improve properties such as flexibility, adhesion, and chemical resistance. On the other hand, multifunctional modifiers have more than one reactive group, allowing them to provide a wider range of enhancements to the resin, such as improved strength, durability, and thermal stability. Both types play crucial roles in tailoring the properties of polyurethane resins for various applications.</p></p>
