<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Powder Polyester Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydroxyl Terminated</li><li>Carboxyl Terminated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Powder Polyester Resins are classified into two types: Hydroxyl Terminated and Carboxyl Terminated. Hydroxyl Terminated resins have hydroxyl groups at the end of their polymer chains, providing better crosslinking with curing agents. They are commonly used in powder coatings for outdoor applications due to their improved weather resistance. On the other hand, Carboxyl Terminated resins contain carboxyl groups and are preferred for indoor applications due to their lower curing temperatures and faster cure times. Both types offer unique properties and are widely used in various industries.</p></p>
