<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embedded Hypervisor Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-Metal Hypervisors</li><li>Hosted Hypervisors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The embedded hypervisor service market consists of two main types: bare-metal hypervisors and hosted hypervisors. Bare-metal hypervisors run directly on the hardware without the need for an operating system. They offer high performance, security, and control, making them ideal for mission-critical applications. Hosted hypervisors, on the other hand, require an underlying operating system and are commonly used on personal computers. They offer increased flexibility and ease of use but may have slightly lower performance compared to bare-metal hypervisors. Both types play a significant role in enabling virtualization and enhancing server efficiency.</p></p>
