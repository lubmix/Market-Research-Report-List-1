<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Type</li><li>Thermosetting Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polyurethane systems are divided into two main types - thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic polyurethane systems are malleable and can be melted and remolded multiple times. They are commonly used in applications where flexibility, durability, and resistance to abrasion are required. On the other hand, thermosetting polyurethane systems undergo a chemical reaction during processing that permanently changes their structure. This results in a rigid and durable final product, making them suitable for applications requiring high strength and chemical resistance.</p></p>
