<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminum Alloy Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aluminum alloy wheels are commonly manufactured using two main processes: casting and forging. Casting involves pouring molten aluminum into a mold to create the wheel shape, offering a cost-effective method of production. On the other hand, forging involves shaping the aluminum using high pressure and heat, resulting in a stronger and lighter wheel. While casting wheels are more affordable and suitable for everyday use, forging wheels are preferred for high-performance vehicles due to their superior strength and weight savings.</p></p>
