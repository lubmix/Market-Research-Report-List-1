<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PVC Blowing Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exothermic Blowing Agent</li><li>Endothermic Blowing Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PVC blowing agents are classified into two main types: exothermic and endothermic blowing agents. Exothermic blowing agents release heat during the foaming process, resulting in a faster expansion and lower density foam. On the other hand, endothermic blowing agents absorb heat during foaming, leading to a slower expansion and higher density foam. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as desired foam properties, processing conditions, and cost considerations.</p></p>
