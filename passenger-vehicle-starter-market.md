<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Starter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Control</li><li>Electromagnetic Control</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct control starters use a direct current (DC) motor to crank the engine, controlled by a switch that directly engages the starter. They are simpler and cheaper than electromagnetic control starters but are less efficient and may wear out faster. Electromagnetic control starters use an electromagnetic solenoid to engage the starter when the ignition key is turned, providing a more reliable and efficient start. They are more commonly found in modern vehicles due to their superior performance and durability.</p></p>
